# ft_linear_regression

The aim of this project is to introduce you to the basic concept behind machine learning.
For this project, you will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a <u>linear function</u> train with a <u>gradient descent algorithm</u>.

We will work on a precise example for the project, but once youâ€™re done you will be able to use the algorithm with any other dataset.
